# AI buyer's agent

Not sure of the project direction yet but the idea is to replace a buyer's agent (an AI Buyer's Agent if you will, since the NAR wiped out this category). 
- present homes
- write offers (validated by human)
- negotiate offers (validated by human)
- close deals 

Using local LLM framework, Ollama https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main
