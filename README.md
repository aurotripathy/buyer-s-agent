# AI buyer's agent

An AI agent is an entity that works on your behalf creating tasks for other agents interactively, sending/receiving messages, performing actions (querying databases, calling APIs, regerate replies, etc) 

Not sure of the project direction yet but the idea is to replace a human buyer's agent with an AI Buyer's Agent (if you will), since the NAR wiped out the buyer agent category (that's the genesis of this idea anyway). 
- present homes
- write offers (validated by human)
- negotiate offers (validated by human)
- close deals
