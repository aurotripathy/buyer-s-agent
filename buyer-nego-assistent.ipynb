Given the flaws you've identified in the construction, we can leverage those as points for negotiation. Here are some strategies we can consider:\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Research comparable sales: Look into recent sales of similar properties in the area, particularly those without construction flaws. Use this data to demonstrate to the seller that their asking price is not in line with market standards, considering the condition of the home.\n",

      "4. Make a reasonable offer: Based on the information gathered, make a reasonable but lower offer that reflects both the market value and the necessary repairs. This can serve as a starting point for negotiations with the seller.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Be prepared to walk away: While we aim to secure the home at a price that works for you, it's important to be prepared to walk away if the seller is not willing to negotiate. This demonstrates your willingness to find a fair deal and can sometimes encourage the seller to reconsider their position.\n",
      "\n",
      "By combining these strategies and leveraging the flaws in the construction, we can work towards securing the home you love at a price point that aligns with your budget. I'll be here to guide you through the negotiation process and help you achieve a successful outcome. Let's start working on your offer and negotiation plan!\n",
